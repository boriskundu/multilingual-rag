MULTILINGUAL EMBEDDINGS APPROACH:
胰岛素抵抗是一种情况，在这种情况下，你的细胞对胰岛素的反应不正常。结果是，你的身体需要更多的胰岛素来帮助葡萄糖进入细胞。最初，你的身体会产生更多的胰岛素以试图让细胞作出反应。然而，随着时间的推移，你的身体可能无法产生足够的胰岛素，导致血糖水平升高。胰岛素抵抗会导致葡萄糖无法有效进入细胞，从而在血液中积聚，导致血糖水平过高。

TRANSLATION PIPELINE APPROACH:
胰岛素抵抗是细胞对胰岛素无法正常反应的一种情况。因此，您的身体需要更多的胰岛素来帮助葡萄糖进入细胞。最初，您的身体会通过产生更多的胰岛素来尝试让细胞做出反应来进行补偿。然而，随着时间的推移，您的身体可能无法产生足够的胰岛素，导致血糖水平升高。这会增加患 2 型糖尿病的风险，因为葡萄糖保留在血液中，而不是进入需要能量的细胞。
