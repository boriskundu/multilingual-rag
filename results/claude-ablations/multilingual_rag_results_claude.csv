इंसुलिन प्रतिरोध क्या है और यह कोशिकाओं में ग्लूकोज के प्रवेश को कैसे प्रभावित करता है?,hindi,What is insulin resistance and how does it affect glucose entry into cells?,". This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond

. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise. You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you: Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms at all. If you do have them, the symptoms develop slowly over several years. They might be so mild that you do not notice them. The symptoms can include: Your health care provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include: Treatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood sugar levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine: You can take steps to helppreventor delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active

Summary: Type 2diabetesis a disease in which your blood glucose, orblood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your main source of energy. It comes from the foods you eat. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well. The glucose then stays in your blood and not enough goes into your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can causehealth problems. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems. Type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors: Type 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin.

Summary: Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which yourblood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is ahormonemade by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy. If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead toserious health conditions.

1. **प्रारंभिक प्रतिक्रिया**: सबसे पहले, आपका शरीर कोशिकाओं को प्रतिक्रिया देने और ग्लूकोज को प्रवेश करने की अनुमति देने के लिए अधिक इंसुलिन बनाकर क्षतिपूर्ति करने की कोशिश करता है।

2. **प्रगतिशील समस्या**: समय के साथ, आपका शरीर प्रतिरोध पर काबू पाने के लिए पर्याप्त इंसुलिन नहीं बना पाता है।

3. **परिणाम**: ग्लूकोज आपकी कोशिकाओं में प्रवेश करने के बजाय आपके रक्त में रहता है जहां उसे ऊर्जा की आवश्यकता होती है, जिससे रक्त ग्लूकोज का स्तर बढ़ जाता है।

Iclevia is contraindicated in women over 35 years of age who smoke [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. Venous Events Use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs [see Contraindications (4) ] . While the increased risk of VTE associated with use of COCs is well-established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, and especially during the postpartum period (see Figure 1). The rate of VTE in females using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman years

. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine besylate. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC)

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC)

But sometimes the changes do not control or lower your high blood pressure. Then you may need to take medicine. There are different types of blood pressure medicines. Some people need to take more than one type. If your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, treating that condition or stopping the medicine may lower your blood pressure.

. The risk of hypertension is increased if bupropion is used concomitantly with MAOIs or other drugs that increase dopaminergic or noradrenergic activity [see Contraindications (4) ] . Data from a comparative trial of the sustained-release formulation of bupropion HCl, nicotine transdermal system (NTS), the combination of sustained-release bupropion plus NTS, and placebo as an aid to smoking cessation suggest a higher incidence of treatment-emergent hypertension in patients treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS. In this trial, 6.1% of subjects treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS had treatment-emergent hypertension compared to 2.5%, 1.6%, and 3.1% of subjects treated with sustained-release bupropion, NTS, and placebo, respectively.

Summary: Heart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems. It's a type of cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but there are ways to prevent and manage many types of heart disease. There are many different types of heart disease. Some you may be born with, calledcongenital heart disease. Other types develop during your lifetime. Coronary artery disease(also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to other heart problems: Other types of heart diseases may affect yourheart valvesor heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).

WARNINGS: WARNINGS SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups ( Diabetes , 19, supp. 2:747-830, 1970). UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2½ times that of patients treated with diet alone

. Debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of anti-diabetic medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested. The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia. These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery

WARNINGS: WARNINGS Hypertension and Angina Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. In hypertensive and angina patients who have congestive heart failure controlled by digitalis and diuretics, metoprolol should be administered cautiously. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be fully digitalized and/or given a diuretic. The response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues, despite adequate digitalization and diuretic therapy, metoprolol should be withdrawn

WARNINGS: WARNINGS Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation is necessary in supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, which is not promptly and effectively controlled by 80 mg of intravenous furosemide or equivalent therapy, is a contraindication to beta blocker treatment. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be treated appropriately according to currently recommended guidelines, and the response observed closely.

Summary: Heart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems. It's a type of cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but there are ways to prevent and manage many types of heart disease. There are many different types of heart disease. Some you may be born with, calledcongenital heart disease. Other types develop during your lifetime. Coronary artery disease(also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to other heart problems: Other types of heart diseases may affect yourheart valvesor heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). The causes of heart disease depend on the type of disease

संदर्भ में केवल वेरेनिकलाइन (धूम्रपान बंद करने की दवा) पर चर्चा की गई है और उल्लेख किया गया है कि यह शराब के प्रभाव को बढ़ा सकता है, रोगियों को यह दवा लेते समय शराब का सेवन कम करने की सलाह दी जाती है। इसमें अंतर्निहित हृदय रोग वाले रोगियों में हृदय संबंधी जोखिमों का भी उल्लेख किया गया है जो वैरेनिकलाइन ले रहे हैं।

हालाँकि, संदर्भ में हृदय रोग के जोखिम पर अत्यधिक शराब के सेवन के सामान्य प्रभावों के बारे में जानकारी नहीं है। इस विषय के बारे में सटीक जानकारी प्राप्त करने के लिए, आपको अन्य स्वास्थ्य देखभाल संसाधनों से परामर्श लेने या किसी स्वास्थ्य सेवा प्रदाता से बात करने की आवश्यकता होगी।","दिए गए संदर्भ के आधार पर, अनुशंसित से अधिक शराब पीने से हृदय रोग का खतरा दो मुख्य तरीकों से बढ़ जाता है:

1. **रक्तचाप बढ़ाता है** - अत्यधिक शराब का सेवन रक्तचाप बढ़ाता है, जो हृदय रोग के लिए एक जोखिम कारक है।

2. **अतिरिक्त कैलोरी जोड़ता है जिससे वजन बढ़ता है** - शराब में अतिरिक्त कैलोरी होती है जो वजन बढ़ने का कारण बन सकती है, और अतिरिक्त कैलोरी और परिणामस्वरूप वजन बढ़ने से हृदय रोग का खतरा बढ़ जाता है।

संदर्भ शराब की खपत को सीमित करने की सिफारिश करता है:
- पुरुषों के लिए प्रति दिन 2 से अधिक पेय नहीं
- महिलाओं के लिए प्रति दिन 1 से अधिक पेय नहीं

संदर्भ स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि हालांकि बिल्कुल भी न पीना सबसे अच्छा है, लेकिन इन सीमाओं के भीतर रहना हृदय स्वास्थ्य के लिए महत्वपूर्ण है। इन अनुशंसित मात्रा से अधिक पीने से रक्तचाप और वजन पर नकारात्मक प्रभाव बढ़ जाएगा, जिससे हृदय रोग का खतरा बढ़ जाएगा।",5.094833850860596,5.94868540763855,0.05549979209899902,0.1819441318511963,5.039334058761597,5.7667412757873535

WARNINGS: WARNINGS Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation is necessary in supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, which is not promptly and effectively controlled by 80 mg of intravenous furosemide or equivalent therapy, is a contraindication to beta blocker treatment. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be treated appropriately according to currently recommended guidelines, and the response observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate treatment, atenolol should be withdrawn (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )

मेपिवाकेन हाइड्रोक्लोराइड का उपयोग किस लिए किया जाता है?,hindi,What is mepivacaine hydrochloride used for?,"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Amitriptyline hydrochloride is an antidepressant with sedative effects. Its mechanism of action in man is not known. It is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system. Amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in adrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Pharmacologically, this action may potentiate or prolong neuronal activity since reuptake of these biogenic amines is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity. This interference with reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin is believed by some to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline.

. chemical structure Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of captopril tablets have not yet been fully elucidated. Its beneficial effects in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. However, there is no consistent correlation between renin levels and response to the drug. Renin, an enzyme synthesized by the kidneys, is released into the circulation where it acts on a plasma globulin substrate to produce angiotensin I, a relatively inactive decapeptide. Angiotensin I is then converted by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II, a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor substance. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, thereby contributing to sodium and fluid retention. Captopril tablets prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibition of ACE, a peptidyldipeptide carboxy hydrolase

Oxidation of the bupropion side chain results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of meta-chlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. The potency and toxicity of the metabolites relative to bupropion have not been fully characterized. However, it has been demonstrated in an antidepressant screening test in mice that hydroxybupropion is one-half as potent as bupropion, while threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion are 5-fold less potent than bupropion. This may be of clinical importance because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites are as high as or higher than those of bupropion

This may be of clinical importance because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites are as high as or higher than those of bupropion",". It has been shown that hydroxylation and N-demethylation, which are detoxification reactions, play important roles in the metabolism of the anesthetic. Three metabolites of mepivacaine have been identified from human adults: two phenols, which are excreted almost exclusively as their glucuronide conjugates, and the N-demethylated compound (2′,6′-pipecoloxylidide). Mepivacaine does not ordinarily produce irritation or tissue damage, and does not cause methemoglobinemia when administered in recommended doses and concentrations.

. Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Mepivacaine is approximately 75% bound to plasma proteins. The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, local anesthetics are distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic or renal disease, addition of epinephrine, factors affecting urinary pH, renal blood flow, the route of drug administration, and the age of the patient

. Distribution In vitro tests show that bupropion is 84% bound to human plasma proteins at concentrations up to 200 mcg/mL. The extent of protein binding of the hydroxybupropion metabolite is similar to that for bupropion, whereas the extent of protein binding of the threohydrobupropion metabolite is about half that seen with bupropion. Metabolism Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans. Three metabolites are active: hydroxybupropion, which is formed via hydroxylation of the tert-butyl group of bupropion, and the amino-alcohol isomers threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, which are formed via reduction of the carbonyl group. In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 enzymes are not involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion

3. बुप्रोपियन का चयापचय

इनमें से किसी भी अनुभाग में स्थानीय एनेस्थेटिक्स या प्लाज्मा प्रोटीन उनकी क्रिया को कैसे प्रभावित करते हैं, इसके बारे में जानकारी नहीं है। आपके प्रश्न का सटीक उत्तर देने के लिए, मुझे विशेष रूप से स्थानीय एनेस्थेटिक फार्माकोलॉजी और प्लाज्मा प्रोटीन के साथ उनकी बातचीत से संबंधित संदर्भ की आवश्यकता होगी।","दिए गए संदर्भ के आधार पर, प्लाज्मा प्रोटीन स्थानीय एनेस्थेटिक्स के वितरण और प्लेसेंटल स्थानांतरण में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाते हैं:

**मुख्य भूमिका: प्लेसेंटल स्थानांतरण को सीमित करना**

संदर्भ विशेष रूप से बताता है कि प्लाज्मा प्रोटीन बाइंडिंग महत्वपूर्ण रूप से प्रभावित करती है कि स्थानीय एनेस्थेटिक्स प्लेसेंटा को कैसे पार करते हैं। स्थानीय एनेस्थेटिक्स के भ्रूण/मातृ अनुपात **प्लाज्मा प्रोटीन बाइंडिंग की डिग्री से विपरीत रूप से संबंधित हैं**। ऐसा इसलिए है क्योंकि प्लेसेंटल ट्रांसफर के लिए केवल मुफ्त, अनबाउंड दवा ही उपलब्ध है।

**मेपिवाकेन के साथ उदाहरण:**

मेपिवाकेन लगभग **75% प्लाज्मा प्रोटीन से बंधा हुआ है**, जिसका अर्थ है कि केवल लगभग 25% दवा मुक्त, अनबाउंड रूप में मौजूद है जो प्लेसेंटा को पार कर सकती है। यह प्रोटीन बंधन एक सुरक्षात्मक तंत्र के रूप में कार्य करता है, जिससे भ्रूण तक पहुंचने वाली दवा की मात्रा कम हो जाती है।

**तंत्र:**

जब एक स्थानीय संवेदनाहारी प्लाज्मा प्रोटीन से अत्यधिक बंधी होती है, तो दवा का कम हिस्सा अपने मुक्त रूप में उपलब्ध होता है:
- क्रॉस जैविक झिल्ली
- नाल के पार स्थानांतरण
- भ्रूण परिसंचरण में वितरित करें

यह प्रोटीन बंधन अनिवार्य रूप से एक भंडार के रूप में कार्य करता है, दवा के एक हिस्से को मातृ परिसंचरण में रखता है और भ्रूण के जोखिम को सीमित करता है, जो गर्भावस्था या प्रसव के दौरान स्थानीय एनेस्थेटिक्स का उपयोग करते समय एक महत्वपूर्ण सुरक्षा विचार है।",5.211040019989014,7.861003637313843,0.06208682060241699,0.1894392967224121,5.148953199386597,7.671564340591431

. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000 or 5 μ g/mL) usually reduces the rate of absorption and plasma concentration of mepivacaine, however, it has been reported that vasoconstrictors do not significantly prolong anesthesia with mepivacaine. Onset of anesthesia with mepivacaine is rapid, the time of onset for sensory block ranging from about 3 to 20 minutes depending upon such factors as the anesthetic technique, the type of block, the concentration of the solution, and the individual patient. The degree of motor blockade produced is dependent on the concentration of the solution. A 0.5% solution will be effective in small superficial nerve blocks while the 1% concentration will block sensory and sympathetic conduction without loss of motor function. The 1.5% solution will provide extensive and often complete motor block and the 2% concentration of mepivacaine hydrochloride will produce complete sensory and motor block of any nerve group

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: 1.2 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of action: Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Onset and duration of anesthesia: The onset of action is rapid. For retrobulbar injection, 4 mL of 4% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP provides an average duration of action of 1 to 1½ hours. This duration may be extended for ophthalmic surgery by the addition of epinephrine, the usual recommended dilution being 1:50,000 to 1:100,000. Hemodynamics: Excessive blood levels may cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. These changes may be attributable to a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded",".

In vitro findings suggest that cytochrome P450IIB6 (CYP2B6) is the principal isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion. Oxidation of the bupropion side chain results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of meta-chlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. The potency and toxicity of the metabolites relative to bupropion have not been fully characterized. However, it has been demonstrated in an antidepressant screening test in mice that hydroxybupropion is one half as potent as bupropion, while threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion are 5-fold less potent than bupropion. This may be of clinical importance because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites are as high or higher than those of bupropion

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Amitriptyline hydrochloride is an antidepressant with sedative effects. Its mechanism of action in man is not known. It is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system. Amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in adrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Pharmacologically, this action may potentiate or prolong neuronal activity since reuptake of these biogenic amines is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity. This interference with reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin is believed by some to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline.

. The pharmacological action of allopurinol is generally believed to be mediated by its oxypurinol metabolite. Effect on Hypoxanthine and Xanthine Reutilization of both hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis is markedly enhanced when their oxidations are inhibited by allopurinol tablets and oxipurinol. This reutilization does not disrupt normal nucleic acid anabolism, however, because feedback inhibition is an integral part of purine biosynthesis. As a result of xanthine oxidase inhibition, the serum concentration of hypoxanthine plus xanthine in patients receiving allopurinol tablets for treatment of hyperuricemia is usually in the range of 0.3 mg/dL to 0.4 mg/dL compared to a normal level of approximately 0.15 mg/dL. A maximum of 0.9 mg/dL of these oxypurines has been reported when the serum urate was lowered to less than 2 mg/dL by high doses of allopurinol tablets

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (high-density lipoprotein), IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the high-affinity LDL receptor

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Verapamil hydrochloride is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow-channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) that exerts its pharmacologic effects by modulating the influx of ionic calcium across the cell membrane of the arterial smooth muscle as well as in conductile and contractile myocardial cells. Mechanism of action Angina: The precise mechanism of action of verapamil hydrochloride as an antianginal agent remains to be fully determined, but includes the following two mechanisms: 1 .

. In vitro findings suggest that cytochrome P450IIB6 (CYP2B6) is the principal isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion. Oxidation of the bupropion side chain results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of meta-chlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. The potency and toxicity of the metabolites relative to bupropion have not been fully characterized. However, it has been demonstrated in an antidepressant screening test in mice that hydroxybupropion is one half as potent as bupropion, while threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion are 5-fold less potent than bupropion. This may be of clinical importance because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites are as high or higher than those of bupropion

. The formation of 4’-hydroxy- diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism.

The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. There is some evidence which suggests that meperidine may produce less smooth muscle spasm, constipation and depression of the cough reflex than equianalgesic doses of morphine. Meperidine, in 60 to 80 mg parenteral doses, is approximately equivalent in analgesic effect to 10 mg of morphine. The onset of action is slightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly shorter. Meperidine is significantly less effective by the oral than by the parenteral route, but the exact ratio of oral to parenteral effectiveness is unknown. In clinical studies, changes in several pharmacokinetic parameters with increasing age have been observed

**प्राथमिक चिकित्सीय क्रियाएँ:**
- **एनाल्जेसिया** (दर्द से राहत)
- **बेहोशी**

**कार्रवाई का तंत्र:**
मेपरिडीन हाइड्रोक्लोराइड में मॉर्फिन के समान गुणात्मक रूप से कई क्रियाएं होती हैं, जो मुख्य रूप से प्रभावित करती हैं:
- केंद्रीय तंत्रिका तंत्र
- चिकनी मांसपेशियों से बने अंग

**नैदानिक लाभ:**
मॉर्फिन की समान एनाल्जेसिक खुराक की तुलना में, मेपरिडीन का उत्पादन हो सकता है:
- कम चिकनी मांसपेशियों की ऐंठन
-कब्ज कम होती है
- कफ प्रतिवर्त का कम अवसाद

**खुराक तुल्यता:**
- 60 से 80 मिलीग्राम पैरेंट्रल मेपरिडीन एनाल्जेसिक प्रभाव में लगभग 10 मिलीग्राम मॉर्फिन के बराबर होता है

**औषधीय विशेषताएं:**
- कार्रवाई की शुरुआत मॉर्फिन की तुलना में थोड़ी अधिक तेज होती है
- क्रिया की अवधि मॉर्फिन से थोड़ी कम होती है
- पैरेंट्रल एडमिनिस्ट्रेशन की तुलना में मौखिक रूप से दिए जाने पर यह काफी कम प्रभावी होता है

. An in vitro study indicated that buspirone did not displace highly protein-bound drugs such as phenytoin, warfarin, and propranolol from plasma protein, and that buspirone may displace digoxin. Buspirone is metabolized primarily by oxidation, which in vitro has been shown to be mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions section.) Several hydroxylated derivatives and a pharmacologically active metabolite, 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP), are produced. In animal models predictive of anxiolytic potential, 1-PP has about one quarter of the activity of buspirone, but is present in up to 20-fold greater amounts

. Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users. First-pass metabolism of EE involves formation of EE-3-sulfate in the gut wall, followed by 2-hydroxylation of a portion of the remaining untransformed EE by hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Levels of CYP3A4 vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of EE hydroxylation. Hydroxylation at the 4-, 6-, and 16- positions may also occur, although to a much lesser extent than 2-hydroxylation. The various hydroxylated metabolites are subject to further methylation and/or conjugation. Excretion About 45% of levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and about 32% are excreted in feces, mostly as glucuronide conjugates","DESCRIPTION: DESCRIPTION Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is a sterile solution for intramuscular, subcutaneous or slow intravenous use as a narcotic analgesic.

. For specific techniques and procedures, refer to standard textbooks. The recommended single adult dose (or the total of a series of doses given in one procedure) of mepivacaine hydrochloride for unsedated, healthy, normal-sized individuals should not usually exceed 400 mg. The recommended dosage is based on requirements for the average adult and should be reduced for elderly or debilitated patients. While maximum doses of 7 mg/kg (550 mg) have been administered without adverse effect, these are not recommended, except in exceptional circumstances and under no circumstances should the administration be repeated at intervals of less than 1 1 / 2 hours. The total dose for any 24-hour period should not exceed 1,000 mg because of a slow accumulation of the anesthetic or its derivatives or slower than normal metabolic degradation or detoxification with repeat administration.

. Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined. Pharmacodynamics Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the antianginal efficacy of continuously delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their antianginal efficacy been restored",". Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Mepivacaine is approximately 75% bound to plasma proteins. The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, local anesthetics are distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic or renal disease, addition of epinephrine, factors affecting urinary pH, renal blood flow, the route of drug administration, and the age of the patient

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose of any local anesthetic administered varies with the anesthetic procedure, the area to be anesthetized, the vascularity of the tissues, the number of neuronal segments to be blocked, the depth of anesthesia and degree of muscle relaxation required, the duration of anesthesia desired, individual tolerance and the physical condition of the patient. The smallest dose and concentration required to produce the desired result should be administered. Dosages of mepivacaine hydrochloride should be reduced for elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease. The rapid injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution should be avoided and fractional doses should be used when feasible. For specific techniques and procedures, refer to standard textbooks

. Local anesthetic solutions containing antimicrobial preservatives (ie, those supplied in multiple-dose vials) should not be used for epidural or caudal anesthesia because safety has not been established with regard to intrathecal injection, either intentionally or inadvertently, of such preservatives. It is essential that aspiration for blood or cerebrospinal fluid (where applicable) be done prior to injecting any local anesthetic, both the original dose and all subsequent doses, to avoid intravascular or subarachnoid injection. However, a negative aspiration does not ensure against an intravascular or subarachnoid injection. Reactions resulting in fatality have occurred on rare occasions with the use of local anesthetics. Mepivacaine with epinephrine or other vasopressors should not be used concomitantly with ergot-type oxytocic drugs, because a severe persistent hypertension may occur

. It has been shown that hydroxylation and N-demethylation, which are detoxification reactions, play important roles in the metabolism of the anesthetic. Three metabolites of mepivacaine have been identified from human adults: two phenols, which are excreted almost exclusively as their glucuronide conjugates, and the N-demethylated compound (2′,6′-pipecoloxylidide). Mepivacaine does not ordinarily produce irritation or tissue damage, and does not cause methemoglobinemia when administered in recommended doses and concentrations.

. The 1.5% solution will provide extensive and often complete motor block and the 2% concentration of mepivacaine hydrochloride will produce complete sensory and motor block of any nerve group. The duration of anesthesia also varies depending upon the technique and type of block, the concentration, and the individual. Mepivacaine will normally provide anesthesia which is adequate for 2 to 2 1 / 2 hours of surgery. Local anesthetics are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Generally, the lower the plasma concentration of drug, the higher the percentage of drug bound to plasma. Local anesthetics appear to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by the degree of plasma protein binding, the degree of ionization, and the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer",".

As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond

Summary: Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which yourblood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is ahormonemade by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy. If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead toserious health conditions. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems

Summary: Type 2diabetesis a disease in which your blood glucose, orblood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your main source of energy. It comes from the foods you eat.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Glipizide primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor in the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane, leading to closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, thereby stimulating the release of insulin. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The insulinotropic response to a meal is enhanced with glipizide extended-release tablets administration in diabetic patients. The postprandial insulin and C-peptide responses continue to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment. In two randomized, double-blind, dose-response studies comprising a total of 347 patients, there was no significant increase in fasting insulin in all glipizide extended-release tablet-treated patients combined compared to placebo, although minor elevations were observed at some doses",".

**它如何影响葡萄糖进入细胞：**

当您出现胰岛素抵抗时，您的细胞将无法对胰岛素信号做出正确反应。结果：

1. **您的身体需要更多胰岛素**来帮助葡萄糖进入您的细胞
2. **最初，您的胰腺会通过产生更多胰岛素来尝试让细胞做出反应来进行补偿**
3. **随着时间的推移，您的身体无法跟上** - 它无法产生足够的胰岛素来克服阻力
4. **血糖水平上升**因为葡萄糖停留在您的血液中，而不是进入需要能量的细胞

胰岛素抵抗通常是**2 型糖尿病**的起点。进展过程是：胰岛素抵抗→胰岛素产生增加→无法产生足够的胰岛素→血糖水平升高。

这就是为什么通过改变生活方式（超重时减肥、减少热量摄入以及加强身体活动）来控制胰岛素抵抗对于预防或延缓 2 型糖尿病非常重要。","根据所提供的背景，**胰岛素抵抗**是细胞对胰岛素无法正常反应的一种情况。

## 它如何影响葡萄糖进入细胞：

当您出现胰岛素抵抗时：

1. **细胞反应减弱**：您的细胞无法对胰岛素信号做出正确反应以允许葡萄糖进入

2. **需要更多的胰岛素**：因此，您的身体需要比正常情况更多的胰岛素来帮助葡萄糖进入细胞

3. **补偿反应**：最初，您的身体试图通过产生更多胰岛素来迫使细胞做出反应来进行补偿

4. **进行性衰竭**：随着时间的推移，您的身体无法跟上不断增加的胰岛素需求，无法产生足够的胰岛素

5. **血糖升高**：最终，血糖水平升高，因为葡萄糖停留在您的血液中，而不是进入需要能量的细胞

## 与 2 型糖尿病的联系：

胰岛素抵抗通常是 2 型糖尿病的起点。它是导致 2 型糖尿病的关键因素之一，还有其他影响因素。这种进行性的情况意味着，即使存在胰岛素，它也无法有效地发挥作用，帮助葡萄糖从血液转移到细胞中以供能量使用。",5.937612533569336,7.877837657928467,0.05467867851257324,0.17926573753356934,5.882933855056763,7.6985719203948975

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but there are ways to prevent and manage many types of heart disease. There are many different types of heart disease. Some you may be born with, calledcongenital heart disease. Other types develop during your lifetime. Coronary artery disease(also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to other heart problems: Other types of heart diseases may affect yourheart valvesor heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).

The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups ( Diabetes , 19, supp. 2:747-830, 1970).

WARNINGS: WARNINGS Hypertension and Angina Cardiac Failure Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. In hypertensive and angina patients who have congestive heart failure controlled by digitalis and diuretics, metoprolol should be administered cautiously. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be fully digitalized and/or given a diuretic. The response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues, despite adequate digitalization and diuretic therapy, metoprolol should be withdrawn

Summary: Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80. High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. They will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis

Also, some common ways of coping with stress, such as overeating, heavy drinking, and smoking, are bad for your heart. Some ways to help manage your stress include exercise, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.Managing diabetes.Having diabetes doubles your risk ofdiabetic heart disease. That is because over time,high blood glucose(blood sugar) from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. So, it is important to gettested for diabetes, and if you have it, to keep it under control.Getting enough sleep.If you don't get enough sleep, you raise your risk of high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes. Those three things can raise your risk of heart disease

. Sometimeswomenwill have different symptoms then men. For example, they are more likely to feel tired for no reason. The most common cause of heart attacks iscoronary artery disease(CAD). With CAD, there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls or the arteries. This isatherosclerosis. It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). Ablood clotcan form around the plaque and block the artery. A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. At the hospital, health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, blood tests, and differentheart health tests. Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such ascoronary angioplasty. After a heart attack,cardiac rehabilitationand lifestyle changes can help you recover.

Summary: Heart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems. It's a type of cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but there are ways to prevent and manage many types of heart disease. There are many different types of heart disease. Some you may be born with, calledcongenital heart disease. Other types develop during your lifetime. Coronary artery disease(also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to other heart problems: Other types of heart diseases may affect yourheart valvesor heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). The causes of heart disease depend on the type of disease

血浆蛋白在局部麻醉药作用中的角色是什么？,chinese,What is the role of plasma proteins in the action of local anesthetics?,"CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Cholesterol and triglycerides circulate in the bloodstream as part of lipoprotein complexes. With ultracentrifugation, these complexes separate into HDL (high-density lipoprotein), IDL (intermediate-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein) fractions. Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the high-affinity LDL receptor

. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in humans following co-administration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration

. The metabolites are observed in the urine. The primary metabolic pathway is hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for human hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 played the predominant role. Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron, it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme (e.g., CYP2D6 genetic deficiency) will be compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron elimination. Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron

Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron",". It has been shown that hydroxylation and N-demethylation, which are detoxification reactions, play important roles in the metabolism of the anesthetic. Three metabolites of mepivacaine have been identified from human adults: two phenols, which are excreted almost exclusively as their glucuronide conjugates, and the N-demethylated compound (2′,6′-pipecoloxylidide). Mepivacaine does not ordinarily produce irritation or tissue damage, and does not cause methemoglobinemia when administered in recommended doses and concentrations.

. Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Mepivacaine is approximately 75% bound to plasma proteins. The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, local anesthetics are distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic or renal disease, addition of epinephrine, factors affecting urinary pH, renal blood flow, the route of drug administration, and the age of the patient

. The 1.5% solution will provide extensive and often complete motor block and the 2% concentration of mepivacaine hydrochloride will produce complete sensory and motor block of any nerve group. The duration of anesthesia also varies depending upon the technique and type of block, the concentration, and the individual. Mepivacaine will normally provide anesthesia which is adequate for 2 to 2 1 / 2 hours of surgery. Local anesthetics are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Generally, the lower the plasma concentration of drug, the higher the percentage of drug bound to plasma. Local anesthetics appear to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by the degree of plasma protein binding, the degree of ionization, and the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer

. In vitro , etoposide is highly protein bound (97%) to human plasma proteins. An inverse relationship between plasma albumin levels and etoposide renal clearance is found in children. In a study determining the effect of other therapeutic agents on the in vitro binding of carbon-14 labeled etoposide to human serum proteins, only phenylbutazone, sodium salicylate, and aspirin displaced protein-bound etoposide at concentrations achieved in vivo . Etoposide binding ratio correlates directly with serum albumin in patients with cancer and in normal volunteers. The unbound fraction of etoposide significantly correlated with bilirubin in a population of cancer patients. Data have suggested a significant Inverse correlation between serum albumin concentration and free fraction of etoposide

. Distribution In vitro tests show that bupropion is 84% bound to human plasma proteins at concentrations up to 200 mcg/mL. The extent of protein binding of the hydroxybupropion metabolite is similar to that for bupropion, whereas the extent of protein binding of the threohydrobupropion metabolite is about half that seen with bupropion. Metabolism Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans. Three metabolites are active: hydroxybupropion, which is formed via hydroxylation of the tert-butyl group of bupropion, and the amino-alcohol isomers threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, which are formed via reduction of the carbonyl group. In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 enzymes are not involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion","CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-met

1. **结合和分布**：局麻药不同程度地与血浆蛋白结合。例如，甲哌卡因大约 75% 与血浆蛋白结合。一般来说，药物的血浆浓度越低，与血浆蛋白结合的百分比越高。

2. **胎盘转移**：血浆蛋白结合对于决定局部麻醉药的胎盘转移至关重要。血浆蛋白结合程度与胎儿/母体比率之间存在**反比关系**。这是因为**只有游离的、未结合的药物可用于胎盘转移**。药物与血浆蛋白的结合越多，穿过胎盘的次数就越少。

3. **药物可用性**：只有局部麻醉剂的未结合（游离）部分具有药理活性，可用于：
   - 穿过生物膜
   - 到达目标组织
   - 产生所需的麻醉效果

4. **浓度依赖性结合**：结合关系是动态的 - 在较低的血浆浓度下，较高百分比的药物与蛋白质结合。

Cross sensitivity among members of the amide-type local anesthetic group has been reported. The usefulness of screening for sensitivity has not been definitely established. Neurologic The incidences of adverse neurologic reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration, and the physical status of the patient.

However, since fludrocortisone acetate is a potent mineralocorticoid, both the dosage and salt intake should be carefully monitored in order to avoid the development of hypertension, edema or weight gain.

Mepivacaine will normally provide anesthesia which is adequate for 2 to 2 1 / 2 hours of surgery. Local anesthetics are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Generally, the lower the plasma concentration of drug, the higher the percentage of drug bound to plasma. Local anesthetics appear to cross the placenta by passive diffusion. The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by the degree of plasma protein binding, the degree of ionization, and the degree of lipid solubility. Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer

. Mepivacaine hydrochloride is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amide-type local anesthetics. It contains an amide linkage between the aromatic nucleus and the amino group.

DESCRIPTION: DESCRIPTION Mepivacaine hydrochloride is 2-Piperidinecarboxamide, N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-1-methyl-, monohydrochloride and has the following structural formula: The molecular formula is C 15 H 22 N 2 O HCl. It is a white, crystalline odorless powder, soluble in water, but very resistant to both acid and alkaline hydrolysis. Mepivacaine hydrochloride is a local anesthetic available as sterile isotonic solutions (clear, colorless) in concentrations of 1%, 1.5% and 2% for injection via local infiltration, peripheral nerve block, and caudal and lumbar epidural blocks. Mepivacaine hydrochloride is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amide-type local anesthetics. It contains an amide linkage between the aromatic nucleus and the amino group

. It has been shown that hydroxylation and N-demethylation, which are detoxification reactions, play important roles in the metabolism of the anesthetic. Three metabolites of mepivacaine have been identified from human adults: two phenols, which are excreted almost exclusively as their glucuronide conjugates, and the N-demethylated compound (2′,6′-pipecoloxylidide). Mepivacaine does not ordinarily produce irritation or tissue damage, and does not cause methemoglobinemia when administered in recommended doses and concentrations.

. A dilute concentration of epinephrine (1:200,000 or 5 μ g/mL) usually reduces the rate of absorption and plasma concentration of mepivacaine, however, it has been reported that vasoconstrictors do not significantly prolong anesthesia with mepivacaine. Onset of anesthesia with mepivacaine is rapid, the time of onset for sensory block ranging from about 3 to 20 minutes depending upon such factors as the anesthetic technique, the type of block, the concentration of the solution, and the individual patient. The degree of motor blockade produced is dependent on the concentration of the solution. A 0.5% solution will be effective in small superficial nerve blocks while the 1% concentration will block sensory and sympathetic conduction without loss of motor function. The 1.5% solution will provide extensive and often complete motor block and the 2% concentration of mepivacaine hydrochloride will produce complete sensory and motor block of any nerve group

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is a combination of the β ​2 -adrenergic bronchodilator, albuterol sulfate, and the anticholinergic bronchodilator, ipratropium bromide. Albuterol sulfate: Mechanism of Action: ​ The prime action of β-adrenergic drugs is to stimulate adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic-3’,5’-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The cAMP thus formed mediates the cellular responses. In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on β ​2 -adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that β ​2 -adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, recent data indicated that 10% to 50% of the β-receptors in the human heart may be β ​2 -receptors. The precise function of these receptors, however, is not yet established","CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocor

Its mechanism of action in man is not known. It is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and it does not act primarily by stimulation of the central nervous system. Amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in adrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Pharmacologically, this action may potentiate or prolong neuronal activity since reuptake of these biogenic amines is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity. This interference with reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin is believed by some to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic and antitussive with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of codeine. Most of these involve the central nervous system and smooth muscle. The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known, although it is believed to relate to the existence of opiate receptors in the central nervous system. In addition to analgesia, narcotics may produce drowsiness, changes in mood and mental clouding. The analgesic action of acetaminophen involves peripheral influences, but the specific mechanism is as yet undetermined. Antipyretic activity is mediated through hypothalamic heat regulating centers. Acetaminophen inhibits prostaglandin synthetase. Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen have negligible effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory systems; however, toxic doses may cause circulatory failure and rapid, shallow breathing

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tramadol hydrochloride tablets contain tramadol, an opioid agonist and inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin re- uptake. Although the mode of action is not completely understood, the analgesic effect of tramadol is believed to be due to both binding to µ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of re- uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O -demethylated metabolite M1 to µ-opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in µ opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opioid antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]

血浆浓度与局部麻醉药物结合之间的关系是什么？,chinese,What is the relationship between plasma concentrations and local anesthetic drug binding?,". At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. However, toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability, which may lead to atrioventricular block and ultimately to cardiac arrest. In addition, myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs, leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. Following systemic absorption, local anesthetics can produce central nervous system stimulation, depression, or both. Apparent central stimulation is manifested as restlessness, tremors, and shivering, progressing to convulsions, followed by depression and coma progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest. However, the local anesthetics have a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers. The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited stage

. Fetal/maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding, because only the free, unbound drug is available for placental transfer. Mepivacaine is approximately 75% bound to plasma proteins. The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug. Lipid soluble, nonionized drugs readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation. Depending upon the route of administration, local anesthetics are distributed to some extent to all body tissues, with high concentrations found in highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, and brain. Various pharmacokinetic parameters of the local anesthetics can be significantly altered by the presence of hepatic or renal disease, addition of epinephrine, factors affecting urinary pH, renal blood flow, the route of drug administration, and the age of the patient

. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of paroxetine and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio. 5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with paroxetine tablet or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of paroxetine, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose of any local anesthetic administered varies with the anesthetic procedure, the area to be anesthetized, the vascularity of the tissues, the number of neuronal segments to be blocked, the depth of anesthesia and degree of muscle relaxation required, the duration of anesthesia desired, individual tolerance and the physical condition of the patient. The smallest dose and concentration required to produce the desired result should be administered. Dosages of mepivacaine hydrochloride should be reduced for elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease. The rapid injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution should be avoided and fractional doses should be used when feasible. For specific techniques and procedures, refer to standard textbooks

. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12% of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10-N-glucuronide, present at steady state at 44% of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4′-N-desmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31% of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed. Direct glucuronidation and cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. In vitro studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavin-containing monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway in vivo, because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

所提供的上下文讨论了与**非甾体抗炎药（NSAID）**相关的肾毒性，而不是唑来膦酸注射液。该信息描述了非甾体抗炎药如何影响肾脏前列腺素形成和肾血流量，特别是在高危患者中，但这与唑来膦酸无关。

为了提供有关唑来膦酸注射液的肾脏副作用的准确信息，我需要有关该药物的具体背景信息。","根据所提供的情况，唑来膦酸注射液的潜在肾脏副作用包括：

1. **肾毒性** - 静脉输注15分钟可降低发生率

2. **肾衰竭** - 通过适当的 15 分钟输注给药同样可以减少

3. **肾脏恶化** - 即使正确给药超过 15 分钟也可能发生

4. **进展为需要透析的肾衰竭** - 这已在临床试验和上市后经验中得到记录

**重要考虑因素：**

- 这些肾脏并发症可能发生在**基线肾功能正常和异常**的患者中

- 在某些情况下**在初始剂量**后发生肾功能恶化

- 即使正确给药（15 分钟内输注 4 毫克），风险仍然存在

**降低风险：**上下文强调，静脉输注唑来膦酸注射液**不少于15分钟**已被证明可以降低肾毒性和肾衰竭的发生率。正确的给药时机对于最大限度地减少肾脏并发症至关重要。

医疗保健提供者应监测接受这种药物的患者的肾功能，特别是考虑到即使采用适当的剂量和给药方案也可能发生严重的肾脏并发症。",5.651671409606934,10.83880615234375,0.04816699028015137,0.41124701499938965,5.603504419326782,10.42755913734436
在唑来膦酸注射液的上市后使用中报告了哪些不良反应？,chinese,What adverse reactions have been reported during post-marketing use of zoledronic acid injection?,"ADVERSE REACTIONS: ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets or other 4-aminoqunoline compounds. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Bone marrow failure, anemia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Hemolysis reported in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency. Cardiac disorders: Cardiomyopathy which may result in cardiac failure and in some cases a fatal outcome (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets prolong the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias and torsade de pointes have been reported in patients taking Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets (see OVERDOSAGE and DRUG INTERACTIONS )

. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of indomethacin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and Appendages: Exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and fixed drug eruption (FDE).

. Laboratory Tests: Mild to moderate elevations of ALT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, BUN and creatinine have been noted. The relationship of these abnormalities to glipizide is uncertain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of glipizide extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure

. Metabolic acidosis has also been reported in patients receiving higher doses. Reports of extravasation with swelling have been received postmarketing. Rarely extravasation has been associated with necrosis and venous induration. The incidences of adverse reactions in the table that follows are derived from multiple databases from studies in 2,081 patients when Etoposide Injection USP was used either orally or by injection as a single agent. ADVERSE DRUG EFFECT PERCENT RANGE OF REPORTED INCIDENCE Hematologic toxicity Leukopenia (less than 1,000 WBC/mm 3 ) 3–17 Leukopenia (less than 4,000 WBC/mm 3 ) 60–91 Thrombocytopenia (less than 50,000 platelets/mm 3 ) 1–20 Thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000 platelets/mm 3 ) 22–41 Anemia 0–33 Gastrointestinal toxicity Nausea and vomiting 31–43 Abdominal pain 0–2 Anorexia 10–13 Diarrhea 1–13 Stomatitis 1–6 Hepatic 0–3 Alopecia 8–66 Peripheral neurotoxicity 1–2 Hypotension 1–2 Allergic reaction 1–2

ADVERSE REACTIONS: ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials and Post-marketing Surveillance The adverse reactions listed below reflect the experience from investigational studies of Amnesteem, and the post-marketing experience. The relationship of some of these events to Amnesteem therapy is unknown. Many of the side effects and adverse reactions seen in patients receiving Amnesteem are similar to those described in patients taking very high doses of vitamin A (dryness of the skin and mucous membranes, e.g., of the lips, nasal passage and eyes). Dose Relationship Cheilitis and hypertriglyceridemia are usually dose related. Most adverse reactions reported in clinical trials were reversible when therapy was discontinued; however, some persisted after cessation of therapy (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS )
