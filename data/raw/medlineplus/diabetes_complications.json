A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy.Withtype 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Withtype 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.What health problems can diabetes cause?Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause complications, including:Eye disease, due to changes in fluid levels, swelling in the tissues, and damage to the blood vessels in the eyes.Foot problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow to your feet.Gum diseaseand other dental problems, because a high amount of glucose in your saliva helps harmful bacteria grow in your mouth. The bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. Plaque also comes from eating foods that contain sugars or starches. Some types of plaque cause gum disease andbad breath. Other types causetooth decayand cavities.Heart diseaseandstroke, caused by damage to your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels.Kidney disease, due to damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys. Many people with diabetes develophigh blood pressure. That can also damage your kidneys.Nerve problems(diabetic neuropathy), caused by damage to the nerves and the small blood vessels that nourish your nerves with oxygen and nutrients.Sexual andbladderproblems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow in the genitals and bladder.Skin conditions, some of which are caused by changes in the small blood vessels and reduced circulation. People with diabetes are also more likely to have infections, includingskin infections.What other problems can people with diabetes have?If you have diabetes, you need to watch out for blood glucose levels that aretoo high(hyperglycemia) ortoo low for you(hypoglycemia). These can happen quickly and can become dangerous. Some of the causes include having another illness or infection and certain medicines.
