  "summary": "What is blood pressure?Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.How is high blood pressure diagnosed?High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. They will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis.Blood Pressure CategorySystolic Blood PressureDiastolic Blood PressureNormalLess than 120andLess than 80Elevated120 - 129andLess than 80High Blood Pressure Stage 1130 - 139or80 - 89High Blood Pressure Stage 2140 or higheror90 or higherHypertensive Crisis (dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away)Higher than 180andHigher than 120For children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex.What are the different types of high blood pressure?There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.:Primary,or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure.
